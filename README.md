# polynomialRegression
# In this data i only have two columns usefull, so I take as X "level columns" and as y "salary column"
# Then I import "LinearRegression" and train my model "lin_reg.fit(X,Y)"
# Now I import "PolynomialFeatures" and set parameter of my "regressor at 4", default is 2, its specifies the maximal degree
# Next I train and transform my X and when I chave my "polynomial features" i can use "linear regression" and get "Polynomial Regression"
